Development is quite straightforward: I build your app. 

I like to lay down a good foundation before starting to code. I start by defining the product requirements, the data model and the app's major components. 

I also follow continuous deployment best practices and document decisions as I go. 

As a result, in addition to the code and app, you get everything you need to continue to build and grow your product.
