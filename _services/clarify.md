Customers buy things for many different reasons: 

* They might have a lot of disposable income and can afford to test products, 
* They might have a specific problem they are trying to solve, 
* They might want to look good or know what the fuss is all about.

So, in order to grow, you need to know _who_ these customers are and _what_ they want. 

And, to engage them effectivly, you will need to lay out an overall acquisition and retention strategy.
