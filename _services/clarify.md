Clarify is about providing actionnable answers to questions, such as: 

* Are we doing the right thing?
* Are we reaching the right people? 
* What could we improve? 

I accomplish this by setting clearly who you are selling to and _what they are buying_. 

Often, _"what people are buying"_ may seem obvious at first. However, as there are often multiple ways to sell a product, _knowing_ what each of your customers are _really_ buying allows you to choose and optimize much more effectively.
