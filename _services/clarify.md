Customers buy things for many different reasons: 

* They might have a lot of disposable income and can afford to test products, 
* They might have a specific problem they are trying to solve, 
* They might want to look good or know what the fuss is all about.

So, in order to grow, you need to know who these customers are and what they want. And, to engage them effectivly, you will need to lay out an overall acquisition and retention strategy.
