The answer to _"Do you know what your customers are buying?"_ may seem obvious at first... they are buying your product! Yet, customers buy things for many different reasons: 

* They might have a lot of disposable income and can afford to test products, 
* They might have a specific problem they are trying to solve, 
* They might want to look good or know what the fuss is all about.

So, in order to grow, you need to know which customer segment is most important, how do you want to pursue them as well as lay out an overall acquisition and retention strategy for all your prospective users.
