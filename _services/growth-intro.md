Growing is hard. You plan campaigns, create marketing material and spend money to get people to your website. Yet, results don't follow. 

That's normal: reaching customers is hard, knowing what people _really_ want or why they _really_ buy is hard, tracking everything properly is hard. 

When trying to grow a product, I help first by clarifying what people buy and why, by structuring your marketing activities so you can test, learn, optimize and by tracking your results accurately so you can make decisions confidently.
