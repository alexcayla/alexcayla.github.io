Structure is about connecting the _what_ to the _how_. 

In short, once you know who you want to reach and where, you need to know _how to do it_ and _what to do if your efforts fail_. 

I help you by establishing how campaigns and growth activities should be organized, executed and evaluated. And, by having a clear idea of what to do next. 

As the saying goes: "success is going from failure to failure without losing your enthusiasm". I want to help you fail faster and better.
