Structure is about connecting the _what_ to the _how_. Once you know who you want to reach and where, in order to improve, you will need to keep track of what was a campaign's expected outcome and what to do if it fails. 

I help by establishing the steps that need to be carried out when planning a growth activity, by documenting growth activities and by carrying out campaigns with internal teams.
