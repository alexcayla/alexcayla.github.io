Design is not how something looks, but how it works. 

This means knowing _who_ you are targeting, _what_ these users want and _how_ you expect them to get value out of your product; and then creating it.  

To that end, I can help clarify who the product is targeting, what they are trying to accomplish, map out the core flows of an app, create high levels mockups and refine the experience of your minimum lovable product.
