<!-- # Product development and growth -->

Hi, I'm Alex! 

I [build compelling digital products](#development) and [help SaaS companies grow](#growth).

I also co-organize product events in Montreal, Canada ([Product Circle](https://www.meetup.com/Product-Circle-Montreal/), [Product Tank](https://www.meetup.com/ProductTank-Montreal/)), I sometimes teach and I maintain a [couple of projects]() for fun and profit.

Regardless of the project, I always start from the customers and their needs. So, if you are looking for Facebook hacks, Google Ads tips and tricks, or quick optimization schemes, I won't be your guy. 

If that is what you are looking for, you can learn more about my services below, or [just get in touch](/contact).
