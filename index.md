<!-- # Product development and growth -->

# Hi, I'm Alex! 

I [build compelling digital products](#development) and [help SaaS companies grow](#growth), I (sometimes) teach and I maintain a [couple of projects](/projects) for fun and profit.


In Montreal, I co-organize product events ([Product Circle](https://www.meetup.com/Product-Circle-Montreal/){:target="_blank"}, [Product Tank](https://www.meetup.com/ProductTank-Montreal/){:target="_blank"}) and have a podcast on digital product development (on hiatus), [prod.](http://www.leprodcast.com){:target="_blank"}

I obssess about user wants and needs and how to the best possibly fulfill them. Happily, I found that understanding customers tends to help products succeed and grow.

If that is what you are looking for, you can learn more about my services below, or [just get in touch](/contact).
