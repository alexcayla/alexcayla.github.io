    Hi, I'm Alex!

    I [build compelling digital products](#development) and [help SaaS companies grow](#growth), I (sometimes) teach and I maintain a [couple of projects](/projects) for fun and profit.

  #   In Montreal, I co-organize product events ([Product Circle](https://www.meetup.com/Product-Circle-Montreal/), [Product Tank](https://www.meetup.com/ProductTank-Montreal/)) and have a podcast on digital product development (on hiatus), [prod.](www.leprodcast.com)

  #   I obssess about user wants and needs and how to the best possibly fulfill them. Happily, I found that understanding customers tends to help products succeed and grow.

  #   If that is what you are looking for, you can learn more about my services below, or [just get in touch](/contact).
