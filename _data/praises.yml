      I’ve had the opportunity to work with Alex on multiple strategic projects (eCom, CRM).
      What I’ve liked the most was his ability to help us change our “traditional” web agency approach to a “product” mindset in a very short period of time.

      I’ve had the pleasure of working with Alexandre on multiple projects at LANDR. I found Alex to be thorough, well-informed and quite astute. Regardless of his initial knowledge of a project, he new how to find the root cause any problem and suggest different possible solutions.
