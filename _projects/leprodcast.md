prod. is a podcast (in French) about digital product development in Québec. 

In it, I interview tech professionals and help them share their best practices, learnings and insights to the benefit of the larger community. 
 
## Project
Like anything, most projects start from a need. I had been involved in the Montreal startup community for some time and felt that it lacked a space where product people could talk about their work, in depth. 

I also wanted this project to be a space where product development would be treated as a craft and where professionals could share their learnings, insights and best practices.

## Challenges
I wanted prod. to have a strong visual identity and to own most of the publishing and monetization channels. 

I quickly realized that most tools for podcasters were not well suited for those goals. They tended to be all-in-one platforms that expected you to manage everything through them. They also tended to do a poor website templates. As a result, I built most of the assets from scratch. 

Promotion, distribution and monetization - core parts of audience building activities - were (and still are) broken, which is what inspired me to launch [L’Ampli](https://www.lampli.ca). The first product being a remote recording solution, [Tincan](https://www.lampli.ca/tincan). 

## Next steps
* Finish preparing and launch the second season
