<p>Hi, I’m Alex!</p>

<p>I <a href="#development">build compelling digital products</a> and <a href="#growth">help SaaS companies grow</a>.</p>

<p>I also co-organize product events in Montreal, Canada (<a href="https://www.meetup.com/Product-Circle-Montreal/">Product Circle</a>, <a href="https://www.meetup.com/ProductTank-Montreal/">Product Tank</a>), I sometimes teach and I maintain a <a href="">couple of projects</a> for fun and profit.</p>

<p>Regardless of the project, I always start from the customers and their needs. So, if you are looking for Facebook hacks, Google Ads tips and tricks, or quick optimization schemes, I won’t be your guy.</p>

<p>If that is what you are looking for, you can learn more about my services below, or <a href="/contact">just get in touch</a>.</p>

    <h2>Product Development</h2>
    <!-- <div class="row"> -->

      <p>You can never get a second chance to make a first impression.</p>

<p>As customers are more likley to trust services that look good and work well, successful products need to be both well-built and well-designed. Depending on your need, I can help with either of those, or both. And, when the time comes to make look good, I know some people that can help.</p>


      

      
        <h3>Design</h3>
        <p><p>Design is about mapping out the core flows of your app, creating high level mockups and refining the experience until your users feel empowered and delighted.</p>

        <h3>Development</h3>
        <p><p>Development is quite straightforward: I build your app.</p>

<p>But, before starting to code, I like to lay a good foundation by defining the product requirements, the data model and the app’s major components. I also follow continuous deployment best practices and document decisions as I go to the best of my abilities.</p>

<p>As a result, in addition to the code and app, you get documents that allow you continue to build and grow your product.</p>

    <h2>Product Growth</h2>
    <p>Growing is hard.</p>

<p>You plan campaigns, create marketing material and spend money to get people to your website. Yet, results might not follow. That’s normal. Knowing what people <em>really</em> want or why the <em>really</em> buy is hard, tracking all of your marketing activities properly, is hard, reaching customers is hard.</p>


    
      
        <h3>Clarify</h3>
        <p><p>Clarify is about providing actionnable answers to questions, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Are we doing the right thing?</li>
  <li>Are we reaching the right people?</li>
  <li>What could we improve?</li>
</ul>

<p>I accomplish this by setting clearly who you are selling to and <em>what they are buying</em>.</p>

<p>Often, <em>“what people are buying”</em> may seem obvious at first. However, as there are often multiple ways to sell a product, <em>knowing</em> what each of your customers are <em>really</em> buying allows you to choose and optimize much more effectively.</p>
</p>
      
        <h3>Structure</h3>
        <p><p>Structure is about connecting intent to action. About organizing marketing activities so that teams know what to do, what to look out for and what to take away from failed experiments. In short, good structure connects the <em>what</em> to the <em>how</em>.</p>

<p>There are multiple benefits to having well structured marketing activities:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Increased velocity</li>
  <li>Increased effectiveness</li>
  <li>Increased confidence</li>
</ul>

<p>What are the questions for structure?</p>
</p>
      
        <h3>Track</h3>
        <p><p>Another important part of structure is tracking. <em>E. g.</em> ensuring that the team has the ability to answer most questions it has about it’s performance.</p>

<p>Sadly, with app analytics, page analytics, social media analytics, tag managers, campaign tracking, things can become complicated very quickly.</p>

<p>So you don’t have to worry about your data all the time, I can architect and implement your analytics infrastructure and create dashboards and automated reports so you can focus on what really matters.</p>
