<p>Hi, I’m Alex!</p>

<p>I <a href="#development">build compelling digital products</a> and <a href="#growth">help SaaS companies grow</a>, I (sometimes) teach and I maintain a <a href="/projects">couple of projects</a> for fun and profit.</p>

<p>In Montreal, I co-organize product events (<a href="https://www.meetup.com/Product-Circle-Montreal/">Product Circle</a>, <a href="https://www.meetup.com/ProductTank-Montreal/">Product Tank</a>) and have a podcast on digital product development (on hiatus), <a href="www.leprodcast.com">prod.</a></p>

<p>I obssess about user wants and needs and how to the best possibly fulfill them. Happily, I found that understanding customers tends to help products succeed and grow.</p>

<p>If that is what you are looking for, you can learn more about my services below, or <a href="/contact">just get in touch</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="development">Product Development</h2>
    <!-- <div class="row"> -->

      <p>A customer is more likley to trust services that looks good and works well.  Depending on your need, I can help with either, or both.</p>


      

      
        <h3>Design</h3>
        <p><p>Design is not how something looks, but how it works.</p>

<p>This means knowing <em>who</em> you are targeting, <em>what</em> these users want and <em>how</em> you expect them to get value out of your product; and then creating it.</p>

<p>To that end, I can help clarify who the product is targeting, what they are trying to accomplish, map out the core flows of an app, create high levels mockups and refine the experience of your minimum lovable product.</p>

        <h3>Development</h3>
        <p><p>Development is quite straightforward: I build your app.</p>

<p>But, before starting to code, I like to lay a good foundation by defining the product requirements, the data model and the app’s major components. I also follow continuous deployment best practices and document decisions as I go to the best of my abilities.</p>

<p>As a result, in addition to the code and app, you get documents that allow you continue to build and grow your product.</p>

    <h2 id="growth">Product Growth</h2>

    <p>You plan campaigns, create marketing material and spend money to get people to your website; yet, results don’t follow. That’s normal: growing is hard.</p>

<p>Reaching customers is hard, knowing what people <em>really</em> want or why they <em>really</em> buy is hard, tracking everything properly is hard.</p>

<p>I help by clarifying what people buy and why, by helping you structure your growth activities so you can test, learn, optimize and by tracking your results accurately so you can make decisions confidently.</p>


    

      

        <h3>Clarify</h3>

        <p><p>Answering <em>“Do you know what your customers are buying?”</em> may seem obvious at first… they are buying your product!</p>

<p>Yet, <em>customers</em> buy things for many different reasons: they have a lot of disposable income and can afford to test products, they have a specific problem they are trying to solve, they want to look good or know what the fuss is all about.</p>

<p>You won’t have just one type of customer. However, it’s important to know which customer segment is more important, how do you want to pursue them as well as lay out an overall acquisition and retention strategy.</p>

<p>Customers might be searching for one, or many of these</p>

<p>However, as there are often multiple ways to sell a product,  allows you to choose and optimize much more effectively.</p>

<p>Clarify is about providing actionnable answers to questions, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Are we doing the right thing?</li>
  <li>Are we reaching the right people?</li>
  <li>What could we improve?</li>
</ul>

<p>I accomplish this by setting clearly who you are selling to and <em>what they are buying</em>.</p>

<p>Often,</p>

        </div>
      

        <h3>Structure</h3>

        <p><p>Structure is about connecting intent to action. About organizing marketing activities so that teams know what to do, what to look out for and what to take away from failed experiments. In short, good structure connects the <em>what</em> to the <em>how</em>.</p>

<p>There are multiple benefits to having well structured marketing activities:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Increased velocity</li>
  <li>Increased effectiveness</li>
  <li>Increased confidence</li>
</ul>

<p>What are the questions for structure?</p>

        <div class="delibs my-4">

            </div>

          
        </div>
      

        <h3>Track</h3>

        <p><p>Another important part of structure is tracking. <em>E. g.</em> ensuring that the team has the ability to answer most questions it has about it’s performance.</p>

<p>Sadly, with app analytics, page analytics, social media analytics, tag managers, campaign tracking, things can become complicated very quickly.</p>

<p>So you don’t have to worry about your data all the time, I can architect and implement your analytics infrastructure and create dashboards and automated reports so you can focus on what really matters.</p>
