      <p>A customer is more likley to trust services that looks good and works well.  Depending on your need, I can help with either, or both.</p>


      

      
        <h3>Design</h3>
        <p><p>Design is not how something looks, but how it works.</p>

<p>This means knowing <em>who</em> you are targeting, <em>what</em> these users want and <em>how</em> you expect them to get value out of your product; and then creating it.</p>

<p>To that end, I can help clarify who the product is targeting, what they are trying to accomplish, map out the core flows of an app, create high levels mockups and refine the experience of your minimum lovable product.</p>

        <h3>Development</h3>
        <p><p>Development is quite straightforward: I build your app.</p>

<p>But, before starting to code, I like to lay a good foundation by defining the product requirements, the data model and the app’s major components. I also follow continuous deployment best practices and document decisions as I go to the best of my abilities.</p>

<p>As a result, in addition to the code and app, you get documents that allow you continue to build and grow your product.</p>

    <h2 id="growth">Product Growth</h2>

    <p>Growing is hard. You plan campaigns, create marketing material and spend money to get people to your website. Yet, results don’t follow.</p>

<p>That’s normal: reaching customers is hard, knowing what people <em>really</em> want or why they <em>really</em> buy is hard, tracking everything properly is hard.</p>

<p>When trying to grow a product, I help first by clarifying what people buy and why, by structuring your marketing activities so you can test, learn, optimize and by tracking your results accurately so you can make decisions confidently.</p>


    

      

        <h3>Clarify</h3>

        <p><p>The answer to <em>“Do you know what your customers are buying?”</em> may seem obvious at first… they are buying your product! Yet, customers buy things for many different reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>They might have a lot of disposable income and can afford to test products,</li>
  <li>They might have a specific problem they are trying to solve,</li>
  <li>They might want to look good or know what the fuss is all about.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, in order to grow, you need to know which customer segment is most important, how do you want to pursue them as well as lay out an overall acquisition and retention strategy for all your prospective users.</p>
</p>

              <div class="card-header"><a href="/deliverables/content-strategy/">Content strategy</a></div>
              <div class="card-body">Outline how to communicate with customers, using which channels, types of content as well as the expected results</div>

            </div>

          
        </div>
      

        <h3>Structure</h3>

        <p><p>Structure is about connecting the <em>what</em> to the <em>how</em>. Once you know who you want to reach and where, in order to improve, you will need to keep track of what was a campaign’s expected outcome and what to do if it fails.</p>

<p>I help by establishing the steps that need to be carried out when planning a growth activity, by documenting growth activities and by carrying out campaigns with internal teams.</p>

            </div>

          
        </div>
      

        <h3>Track</h3>

        <p><p>Everyone claims to be data-driven. Yet, very few people are.</p>

<p>This is quite understandable: as digital channels multiply, people have to contend with app analytics, page analytics, social media analytics, tag managers, campaign tracking, etc. In short, things become very complicated, very quickly.</p>

<p>To ensure that you can answer your most pressing questions, I architect and implement your analytics infrastructure, create dashboards and reports and provide instructions on how to properly tag and track your camapigns.</p>
