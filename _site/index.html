        <h3>DESIGN</h3>

        <p><p>Design is not how something looks, but how it works.</p>

<p>This means knowing <em>who</em> you are targeting, <em>what</em> these users want and <em>how</em> you expect them to get value out of your product; and then creating it.</p>

<p>To that end, I can help clarify who the product is targeting, what they are trying to accomplish, map out the core flows of an app, create high levels mockups and refine the experience until we find a minimum lovable product.</p>

    <p>Growing is hard. You plan campaigns, create marketing material and spend money to get people to your website. Yet, results don’t follow.</p>

<p>That’s normal: reaching customers is hard, knowing what people <em>really</em> want or why they <em>really</em> buy is hard, tracking everything properly is hard.</p>

<p>When trying to grow a product, I help first by clarifying what people buy and why, by structuring your marketing activities so you can test, learn, optimize and by tracking your results accurately so you can make decisions confidently.</p>
