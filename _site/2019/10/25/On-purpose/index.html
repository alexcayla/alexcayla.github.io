  <h1 class="post-title">On Purpose</h1>
  <div class="post-content">
    <p>Over the past year, I’ve had the luxury of mainly focusing on projects that I wanted to do.</p>

<p>Obviously, things are never that simple (I still had bills to pay), so I taught, did some consluting work, etc. But, overall, I still had time to pursue my own projects and to try to make the most out of them.</p>

<p>This forced me to have to answer <em>“hard”</em> questions: why was I doing what I was doing? What did I want to accomplish? I short, if I wanted to use my time meaningfully, what was my purpose?</p>

<hr />

<ul>
  <li>What was I selling?</li>
  <li>What did I want to do?</li>
</ul>

<p>I short, if I had to luxury to live meaningfully,</p>

<p>I also did a podcast. When I spoke with people about their jobs and their work.</p>

<p>Getting them to open up was hard because, often, a job is… a job.</p>

<p>Poeple don’t typically have autonomy or do not get the luxury of defining their work.</p>

<p>I don’t know if this is something that is true for all companies. If more successful ones give more autonomy to their teams.</p>

<p>It surpised me because I think deeply about my work.</p>

<p>I like working on products and on designing</p>

<p>because it is my way of feeling that I am contributing to the world. Well designed products make peoples daily lives a little better. And, in a time of unrest, of diminishing social liberties, of increasing weatl inequality, this is my way of feeling that I am in control and prodiving.</p>

<p>Yet, I don’t think</p>
