<p>Development is quite straightforward: I build your app.</p>

<p>But, before starting to code, I like to lay a good foundation by defining the product requirements, the data model and the app’s major components. I also follow continuous deployment best practices and document decisions as I go to the best of my abilities.</p>

<p>As a result, in addition to the code and app, you get documents that allow you continue to build and grow your product.</p>
