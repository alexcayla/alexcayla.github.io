<p>Development is quite straightforward: I build your app.</p>

<p>I like to lay down a good foundation before starting to code. I start by defining the product requirements, the data model and the appâ€™s major components.</p>

<p>I also follow continuous deployment best practices and document decisions as I go.</p>

<p>As a result, in addition to the code and app, you get everything you need to continue to build and grow your product.</p>
