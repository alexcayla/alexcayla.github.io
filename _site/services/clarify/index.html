<p>Answering <em>“Do you know what your customers are buying?”</em> may seem obvious at first… they are buying your product!</p>

<p>Yet, <em>customers</em> buy things for many different reasons: they have a lot of disposable income and can afford to test products, they have a specific problem they are trying to solve, they want to look good or know what the fuss is all about.</p>

<p>You won’t have just one type of customer. However, it’s important to know which customer segment is more important, how do you want to pursue them as well as lay out an overall acquisition and retention strategy.</p>

<p>Customers might be searching for one, or many of these</p>

<p>However, as there are often multiple ways to sell a product,  allows you to choose and optimize much more effectively.</p>

<p>Clarify is about providing actionnable answers to questions, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Are we doing the right thing?</li>
  <li>Are we reaching the right people?</li>
  <li>What could we improve?</li>
</ul>

<p>I accomplish this by setting clearly who you are selling to and <em>what they are buying</em>.</p>

<p>Often,</p>
