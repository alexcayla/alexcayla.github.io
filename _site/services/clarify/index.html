<p>Clarify is about providing actionnable answers to questions, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Are we doing the right thing?</li>
  <li>Are we reaching the right people?</li>
  <li>What could we improve?</li>
</ul>

<p>I accomplish this by setting clearly who you are selling to and <em>what they are buying</em>.</p>

<p>Often, <em>“what people are buying”</em> may seem obvious at first. However, as there are often multiple ways to sell a product, <em>knowing</em> what each of your customers are <em>really</em> buying allows you to choose and optimize much more effectively.</p>
