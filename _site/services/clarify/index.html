<p>Customers buy things for many different reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>They might have a lot of disposable income and can afford to test products,</li>
  <li>They might have a specific problem they are trying to solve,</li>
  <li>They might want to look good or know what the fuss is all about.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, in order to grow, you need to know <em>who</em> these customers are and <em>what</em> they want.</p>

<p>And, to engage them effectivly, you will need to lay out an overall acquisition and retention strategy.</p>
