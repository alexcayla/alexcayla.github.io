<p>Structure is about connecting the <em>what</em> to the <em>how</em>.</p>

<p>In short, once you know who you want to reach and where, you need to know <em>how to do it</em> and <em>what to do if your efforts fail</em>.</p>

<p>I help you by establishing how campaigns and growth activities should be organized, executed and evaluated. And, by having a clear idea of what to do next.</p>

<p>As the saying goes: “success is going from failure to failure without losing your enthusiasm”. I want to help you fail faster and better.</p>
