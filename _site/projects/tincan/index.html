    <p>Record remote interviews, without compromises.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>
<p>The main <em>persona</em> using tincan is either a podcaster, a journalist or a product manager. In short, someone that wants to record conversations to get new insights <em>and</em> that wants to share the result with others.</p>

<p>Tools such as Skype, Hangouts or Zoom make it easy to speak with people and record conversations. However, they are not ideal: typically, the audio quality of these conversations is not great and they don’t offer a simple way to group conversations.</p>

<h2 id="the-idea">The idea</h2>

<p>Invitees are partly to blame for the poor audio quality: often, they will use earbuds in a room with a lot of echo. But, services like Skype are also to blame as they will compress the audio too much, introducing artefacts and giving them that distinct “conversation over the Internet” sound.</p>

<p><em>Tincan</em> wants to solve this problem by relying on a technique commonly used by podcasters and radios – <em>two-end recording</em> – but packaged in an app, so that “low tech” guests can don’t have to think about it.</p>

<p>Recordings in <em>Tincan</em> are also grouped in topics so that multiple conversations stay organized together.</p>

<h2 id="the-app">The app</h2>

<p>The idea behind “two-end” recording is quite simple: record the best version possible on your devise and have someone stich them together in “post-production”.</p>

<p>The app has three main flows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a new topic</li>
  <li>Start and record a conversation</li>
  <li>Playback conversations and export</li>
</ol>

<p>What does it do?</p>

<img src="/assets/pictures/tincan/tincan-playback.png" alt="playback" class="post-image" /></p>

<p>The idea behind tincan was twofold:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Make recording conversations as easy as making a call, while having the best possible audio quality.</li>
  <li>Group related conversations together</li>
</ol>
